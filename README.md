CREATION OF TOKEN

DESCRIPTION

This code describes Mycontract, a smart contract that controls a simple coin. It permits the minting of new tokens and the burning of existing tokens. Here the token with the symbol "btc" named "mycoin" is implemented in this Solidity smart contract. It keeps track of the total amount of tokens available and the balances of all the addresses. The contract permits the burning and minting of tokens. Burning functions reduce the total quantity of tokens by destroying sender's tokens, minting functions increase the total supply of tokens and allocate new tokens to specific address. it's just a basic token contract,there are not included features like access control etc.
